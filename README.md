## 💡 How It Works

1. User inputs monthly income and a list of expenses.  
2. The app formats this input into a prompt for the OpenAI GPT API.  
3. GPT returns:
   - Summary of expenses
   - Suggestions to cut costs
   - Savings recommendations
   - Expense distribution (needs, wants, savings)  
4. The output is shown inside the Streamlit interface.

## 🧪 Sample Input

```
Income: ₹50,000

Expenses:
- Rent: ₹12,000
- Groceries: ₹6,000
- Transport: ₹3,000
- Entertainment: ₹4,000
- Subscriptions: ₹1,000
```

---

## 📤 Sample Output

```
💡 Budget Analysis:
You've spent ₹26,000, which is 52% of your monthly income.

📌 Suggestions:
- Try to reduce entertainment expenses to ₹2,000/month.
- Subscriptions may be optimized — consider cancelling unused ones.

✅ Ideal Distribution (50/30/20 Rule):
- Needs (50%): ₹25,000
- Wants (30%): ₹15,000
- Savings (20%): ₹10,000

👏 You can potentially save ₹24,000. Great work!
